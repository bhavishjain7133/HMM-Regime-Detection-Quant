# Hidden Markov Model Based Regime Detection in Indian Equity Returns

This project applies a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model to Reliance Industries
daily log-returns to identify latent market regimes and analyze regime-dependent risk.

## Features
- Regime identification using HMM
- Regime-wise volatility and transition analysis
- Regime-specific Value-at-Risk computation
- Regime-aware risk control strategy

## Tech Stack
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, hmmlearn

## Output Example
